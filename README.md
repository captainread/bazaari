# Bazaari

Live site: https://captainread.github.io/bazaari

## Project summary

A mock online marketplace app built using **React** and boostrapped with create-react-app.

This project was one of my first experiences of working with an API to request, display, and interact with data.

Due to the short timeframe of the project, some features are missing or represented with placeholders - such as the search function, item posting, user login, etc.

I employed mobile-first design principles, and the site is best viewed on mobile.
